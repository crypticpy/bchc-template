A comment that appears once is still in the report, with its text, because in a land use process the single most useful comment is often the one nobody else made."

## Problem

A draft zoning update drew 4,100 comments across a web form, email and three open houses. Two planners read all of them and wrote a summary, which took about six weeks and arrived after the council had already held its first discussion.

The deeper problem was that nobody, including the planners, could check the summary. It said things like "many commenters raised concerns about parking." Many is not a number, and there was no way to get from that sentence back to the comments it came from.

## What we built

A notebook that produces a theme report. It embeds every comment, clusters them, proposes a label for each cluster, and writes out a table: theme, number of comments, number of distinct submitters, number of form letters, a representative quotation, and a link to the full list of comments in that theme.

A planner reviews and edits every theme label before publication, merges clusters that are the same argument, and splits ones that are not. That review is where the judgement lives, and it takes about a day.

## How it works

Embeddings and clustering run locally on a laptop with open-source models — no comment text needs to leave the building for the part that produces the counts. The only step that calls a hosted model is the first-draft theme label, and that step is optional; the labels can be written by hand and the report is identical in every other respect.

The design rule we kept coming back to: every number in the report must be clickable. If the report says 312 comments raised setbacks, a reader can open all 312. That constraint killed several fancier ideas and is the reason we would defend the tool in a hearing.

## Results

The zoning comment set was summarized in two days instead of six weeks, and the report went to the council with the staff recommendation instead of after it.

The published themes surfaced two arguments the manual summary from a comparable earlier process had missed entirely, both of them from a small number of comments — six and eleven — that got lost in the volume the first time round. One of them changed a provision in the final draft.

Clustering is genuinely bad at short comments. Anything under about fifteen words lands in a low-confidence bucket that a planner reads individually; that bucket was 9% of the comment set and there is no clever fix for it in the tool.

## Lessons learned

Publish the method note alongside the report. Ours states what the tool does, what it cannot do, and that a human edited every theme label. The first question at the public meeting was "did a computer decide what we said," and the answer needed to already be written down.

Never report themes without also reporting distinct submitters and form letters. A single number is a summary someone can game, and we would rather hand a reader three honest numbers than one clean one.

Keep the counting step local and deterministic. It made the privacy conversation trivial and it means the report can be regenerated by anyone with the comment file, which is the definition of checkable.

## How to reuse

The repository has a worked example over a published comment set, so you can run it end to end before pointing it at your own. We took the transcript-splitting approach and the "every claim links to its source" rule from the clerk's meeting summary entry in this catalog; that rule is the one thing we would insist on carrying over. An analyst comfortable with Python has this running in an afternoon.
