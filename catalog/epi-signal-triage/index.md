## Problem

Every morning the surveillance team receives between 40 and 80 automated alerts from the syndromic system. Most are noise — a holiday effect, a facility that changed its coding, a weekend injury bump. A handful matter. Reading all of them by hand took two analysts about 90 minutes a day, and the reading happened before anyone had context on what had already been ruled out.

## What we built

A scheduled Python job pulls the alert export each night. For every signal it assembles 14 days of visit history, the expected count from a simple seasonal baseline model, and the relevant syndrome definition. It then asks a language model to do three things: say in one sentence what changed, rate how strongly the data supports a real increase, and suggest the single most useful follow-up query.

The results land in a ranked queue that the on-duty analyst works through. Nothing is closed automatically. The analyst opens each signal, reads the draft note, edits it, and records the decision — which is also how we collect training examples for the next round of prompt work.

## How it works

The enrichment step is ordinary Python and SQL against our own warehouse. The model never sees record-level data; it receives a small table of counts, a baseline, and text from our syndrome definitions. Prompts and the evaluation notebook live in the repository so another team can see exactly what we asked for.

Signal strength is deliberately presented as a sorting hint, not a score. It changes the order of the queue and nothing else.

## Results

Review time dropped from roughly 90 minutes to 30 across two analysts. Two clusters were opened a day earlier than they would have been under the old manual sweep. Agreement between the drafted strength rating and the analyst's own judgement was 84% over the first eight weeks, which we consider good enough for sorting and nowhere near good enough for automation.

## Lessons learned

The prompt is about 60 lines. The hard part was the enrichment — getting a clean baseline and a stable facility list took far longer than anything involving the model. Writing the evaluation before the pilot, rather than after, is what let us defend keeping it.

## How to reuse

Start from the data you already export nightly. Replace the three loader functions with your own sources, then run the evaluation notebook against a month of historical alerts before letting anyone rely on the ranking. We are happy to share the syndrome mapping tables on request.
