## Problem

Roughly 9,000 permit applications a year arrive through the online portal, and close to half of them were returned to the applicant for something missing — an unsigned form, no site plan, an expired contractor licence. A permit technician found that out by opening every attachment and comparing it against a submittal checklist that lives in a different document for each of 34 permit types. The check took eight to ten minutes per application, and the queue ran three to five days behind for most of the year.

The cost of that delay was not evenly spread. An applicant with a permit expediter on retainer got their corrections back the same afternoon. A homeowner filing their own deck permit waited a week to find out they had forgotten one form.

## What we built

A service that sits between the portal and the permitting system. When an application lands, it reads the attached documents, extracts the fields that the submittal checklist for that permit type asks for, and produces one of three outcomes: complete and routed to a plan reviewer, incomplete with a specific list of what is missing, or unclear and sent to a technician to look at.

The checklists were the real work. They existed as 34 separate documents written over about fifteen years, and turning them into one machine-readable rubric took longer than building the service. That rubric is in the repository and is probably the most reusable thing here.

## How it works

Uploaded documents go through Azure AI Document Intelligence for text and layout. A model then answers a fixed set of questions per permit type — is there a site plan, is the contractor licence number present and unexpired, is the valuation stated — using only the extracted text, and it must cite the page it took each answer from. The citation requirement is what makes the output checkable; a technician clicks through to the page rather than taking the answer on trust.

Nothing is rejected automatically. "Incomplete" means the applicant gets a message listing what is missing, which is what a technician would have sent anyway. "Unclear" always goes to a person. Complete applications route to a reviewer and a technician spot-checks 10% of them each week.

Everything is deployed with Terraform into the city's own subscription.

## Results

Over the first four months in production, applications returned for a missing document dropped from 46% of intake to 12%, because most of what used to be caught after a three-day wait is now caught at submission while the applicant still has the file open. Median time from submission to first response went from 3.4 days to under an hour.

The 10% spot check has found the model wrong 27 times in four months, almost all of them in the same direction: calling something complete when a required drawing was a placeholder page. We now check drawing sets separately and more strictly, which is the change the spot check paid for.

## Lessons learned

Write the rubric with the technicians who currently apply it, in a room, before you write any code. Half of our checklist items turned out to be applied differently by different technicians, and the model made the disagreement visible rather than causing it.

Do not let the model reject anything. Every design conversation where someone proposed auto-rejection ended with a case where a person would have made the call differently, and the value was never in rejection anyway — it was in telling the applicant sooner.

Budget for the drawing files. Text-heavy PDFs are easy; a 40 MB drawing set with a scanned cover sheet is where the extraction gets expensive and slow.

## How to reuse

Clone the repository, replace the rubric with your own checklists, and expect the rubric work to be most of the project. We used an AI coding assistant heavily for the parsing and infrastructure code, which is why `ai_role` says both. A developer with cloud access can have the shadow-mode deployment running in a week; getting the checklists agreed took us eleven.
