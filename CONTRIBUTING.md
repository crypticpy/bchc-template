# Contributing

Thanks for helping. This file is for people changing the **template itself** — templates, styles,
scripts, workflows, docs. If you want to add or edit a *catalog entry*, you don't need any of this:
use the site's **Submit** page, or follow `docs/admin-guide.md` if you maintain a deployment. If you
have just created a repository from the template and want it launched, that is
`docs/launch.md`. [`docs/index.md`](docs/index.md) routes to the rest.

## Local setup

Requirements: Ruby 3.3 (with Bundler), Node 22+, and — only for the audit scripts — a Chrome that
`pa11y`/Lighthouse can launch (they download one on first run).

```sh
bundle install
npm ci
npm run serve          # builds CSS, then `jekyll serve --livereload` on http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

`npm run watch:css` in a second terminal rebuilds Tailwind as you edit `assets/css/components/*.css`.

## The gates (what CI runs)

Run these before opening a pull request; `validate.yml` and `quality.yml` run the same commands.

| Command | Checks |
|---|---|
| `node scripts/generate.mjs --check` | The issue template, `_config.yml` title/description and `defaults.generated.js` match `_data/schema.yml` / `_data/site.yml`. If it fails: `npm run generate` and commit. |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over the JS in `assets/js/`, `scripts/` and `test/`. |
| `npm run format:check` | Prettier, checked but not applied — run `npm run format` locally to fix. Scope is JavaScript only: `.prettierignore` leaves Markdown, YAML, HTML/Liquid, generated files and the component CSS (one selector per line, see `docs/design-system.md`) alone. |
| `npm test` | Node unit tests (`test/**/*.test.mjs`) — configurator, issue parsing, images, YAML, submit form (jsdom). |
| `npm run test:ruby` | Minitest for the Ruby plugins and validators (`test/plugins/**/*_test.rb`, `test/scripts/**/*_test.rb`). |
| `npm run validate` | Every `_data/*.yml` parses; every entry's front matter passes `scripts/check_front_matter.rb`; no oversize files. |
| `npm run build:css && bundle exec jekyll build` | The site builds without Liquid errors. |
| `npm run a11y` | pa11y-ci (axe + HTML_CodeSniffer, WCAG 2 AA) over the pages in `quality/pa11yci.js` (sample entry URLs are discovered from the built site). Needs the built site served on port 4173: `python3 -m http.server 4173 --directory _site &`. |
| `npm run lighthouse` | Lighthouse CI (`quality/lighthouserc.js`) against the same local server; accessibility ≥ 0.95 is required, other categories warn. |

## Ground rules

1. **The schema is the source of truth.** Never write a field key into a layout, include, script or
   workflow — read `site.data.schema.fields` and act on its hints (`facet`, `card`, `search`,
   `group`, `placement`, `option_meta`…). If a feature needs to know something about a field, add a
   hint to the schema and document it in `docs/content-model.md`. After editing `_data/schema.yml`
   run `npm run generate` and commit the regenerated files with your change.
2. **Configuration over code.** Anything a deployment might want different belongs in `_data/*.yml`
   with a documented key, not in a template.
3. **Prefix Liquid assigns inside includes** (`ec_`, `fv_`, `gal_`…). Jekyll includes share the
   caller's scope, so an unprefixed `v` or `entries` silently clobbers the page's. Use `x.first` to
   detect arrays; assign before passing anything with bracket access to an include. Details in
   `CLAUDE.md`.
4. **Escape at the edge.** Anything from front matter or issue bodies that lands in an attribute or
   URL goes through `| escape` (Liquid) or the helpers in `scripts/lib/`. Scripts treat issue text as
   untrusted; see `SECURITY.md`.
5. **Small, readable JavaScript.** One IIFE per concern, no build step, no dependencies beyond the
   vendored Lunr. Every script starts with a header comment stating what DOM it expects and what
   events/globals it exposes.
6. **Design system, not one-offs.** New UI uses the tokens and component classes in
   `docs/design-system.md` (and the `/styleguide/` page). New colours, radii or shadows are a
   design-system change first.
7. **Accessibility is part of "done".** Keyboard path, focus visibility, 4.5:1 text contrast,
   `prefers-reduced-motion`, and names for icon-only controls. The a11y gate must stay green.
8. **Document what you add.** New config keys → `docs/configuration.md`; new schema hints →
   `docs/content-model.md`; new workflows/scripts → `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/admin-guide.md`;
   a new document → a row in `docs/index.md`. A choice a future contributor would otherwise argue
   with → `docs/decisions.md`. User-facing changes get a line in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Adding a schema hint or field type (walkthrough)

Most feature work touches the same chain. Suppose you add a new presentation hint:

1. `_data/schema.yml` — use it on at least one field; describe it in the header comment.
2. `assets/js/configurator/schema-validate.js` — accept it (warn, don't error, on unknown values).
3. `_plugins/schema_filters.rb` — a filter if templates need to query it.
4. The consumer (`_includes/entry-card.html`, `_layouts/entry.html`, `submit/index.md`,
   `scripts/new_entry_from_issue.mjs`, `scripts/check_front_matter.rb` …) — read the hint, never the key.
5. Presets in `assets/js/configurator/presets/` if the hint should ship with a preset.
6. `docs/content-model.md` — one row in the hints table.
7. `npm run generate`, then all the gates above.

## Pull requests

- Conventional titles: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`; one concern per PR.
- Say what you verified (which gates, which pages you looked at, at which widths). Screenshots for UI.
- Keep generated files (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-entry.yml`, `assets/js/configurator/defaults.generated.js`)
  in the same commit as the schema change that produced them.
- Don't hand-edit generated files — CI's `generate.mjs --check` will fail.

## Reporting problems

Open an issue with the page URL (or file), what you expected, what happened, and browser/width if it
is a UI problem. Security concerns: see `SECURITY.md`.
