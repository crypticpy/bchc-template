# PHCT and BCHC release-readiness status

- Evidence date: 2026-08-22
- PHCT starting baseline: `c9fcb223826f2fc8c945d894420c16a2b8ff5da0`
- PHCT candidate: `v1.9.0-rc.1` in [PR #14](https://github.com/crypticpy/phct/pull/14);
  implementation head `78200bf565ff271a27033693f05f1fc864a77892` passed all six automated
  workflows, while independent review and the immutable tag remain pending
- BCHC baseline: `7ea8659ffeb4de7c1f8f53eb93e4d74a15d4fc31`; the protected updater
  bootstrap is in [PR #2](https://github.com/crypticpy/bchc-ai-use-case-catalog/pull/2), whose
  implementation head `013c9fac20413158704174670d9f974e92cfe6de` passed all three installed
  workflows; the broader compatibility mirror remains uncommitted pending a tagged parent update
- Automated code baseline: **green**
- Stable release and BCHC handoff: **no-go until the human and live-repository gates below pass**

This is the dated evidence record for the canonical
[release-readiness plan](release-readiness-plan.md). A green local test run proves that the
candidate is technically coherent; it does not replace pull-request review, live GitHub workflow
rehearsals, accessibility testing with people and assistive technology, or an operational handoff.

The uncommitted BCHC working tree is a local compatibility mirror used to exercise the same audit
controls against BCHC's preserved configuration, content, media, name, and branding. It is **not**
the final provenance for a downstream code update. Keep only the small ownership/update bootstrap
in a preparation pull request; commit and tag PHCT first, then regenerate BCHC's generic code diff
with the tagged updater. Do not merge a hand-copied generic update or advance the BCHC lock before
that updater succeeds.

## Automated evidence

| Area | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Reproducible toolchain | Pass | Node 22.22.2, npm 10.9.4, Ruby 3.3.11, and Bundler 4.0.11 are exact-pinned and checked by `npm run doctor`. |
| Live pull-request CI | Pass at implementation heads | PHCT PR #14 passed Validate Content, Quality, Performance and scale, Supply chain, CodeQL, and Lint workflows at `78200bf`. BCHC PR #2 passed Validate Content, Quality, and Lint workflows at `013c9fa`. Both PRs are open and ready for independent review. |
| PHCT release verification | Pass | `npm run verify` completed on the final working tree: 551 Node tests, 200 Ruby tests with 503 assertions, 89 build-matrix tests, generated-file checks, preset/module/showcase builds, CSS, Jekyll, license, security-exception, SBOM, image, and internal-link gates. |
| BCHC regression verification | Pass | `npm run verify` completed on the final working tree: doctor, 551 Node tests, 200 Ruby tests with 503 assertions, validation, license, security-exception, SBOM, image, 71 downstream build tests, CSS, Jekyll, and internal-link gates. |
| Dependency vulnerabilities | Pass | `npm audit --audit-level=high` found zero vulnerabilities. `bundler-audit` found no unpatched Ruby advisories. |
| Secret scanning | Pass | Gitleaks v8.30.1 found no leaks in either working tree or the complete history of either repository. |
| Workflow syntax | Pass | `actionlint` accepted all workflow files in both repositories. |
| Accessibility automation | Pass | Pa11y reported zero errors on 22 PHCT URLs and 18 BCHC URLs; all four keyboard-flow scenarios passed in each repository. |
| Desktop Lighthouse | Pass | Four URLs and two runs per URL in each repository. Every category score was 100. PHCT maxima: FCP 323 ms, LCP 548 ms, TBT 0 ms, CLS 0.00186. BCHC maxima: FCP 324 ms, LCP 551 ms, TBT 0 ms, CLS 0.01155. |
| Mobile Lighthouse | Pass | PHCT and BCHC scored 97–99 performance and 100 accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Maximum observed FCP was 1,280 ms, LCP 2,632 ms, TBT 0 ms, and CLS 0.008. |
| Scale matrix | Pass at supported ceiling | Deterministic 0, 1, 10, 100, 500, and 1,000-entry builds completed. All enforced release budgets passed through the supported 100-entry ceiling. |
| Supported 100-entry target | Pass | 5,278 ms build, 474 files, 21,182,458 output bytes, 61,292-byte gzip catalog, 9,081 DOM nodes, 24,895-byte gzip CSS, and 30,289-byte gzip catalog JavaScript. |
| Higher-scale characterization | Informational finding | At 500 entries the catalog was 175,098 bytes gzip with 37,800 DOM nodes; at 1,000 entries it was 319,579 bytes gzip with 73,700 DOM nodes. Pagination or incremental rendering is required before claiming support above 100 entries. |
| Protected downstream content | Pass in tests | The machine-readable ownership manifest, ordered merge rules, protected-file checksums, generated-file regeneration, and immutable parent lock are tested. A real tagged-update pull request remains required. |

Local Lighthouse and scale reports were written under `/tmp` and are intentionally ephemeral.
The release candidate's GitHub Actions runs must retain their reports and SBOM as reviewable CI
artifacts.

## Defects fixed during the audit

- Added missing protection for BCHC-owned governance, search, derivative metadata, content,
  media, identity, and BCHC-specific documentation.
- Replaced moving template references with an exact-tag/full-SHA update contract and added a
  downstream PHCT lock file.
- Fixed the updater's clean-runner path: it now fetches both locked/current and target tags,
  verifies the locked tag's full commit, reselects the candidate's exact Node and Ruby after merge,
  branches from the default branch, uses a lease-protected push, and dispatches all five release
  workflows when GitHub suppresses pull-request events.
- Protected downstream code ownership, maintainer assignment, and support commitments alongside
  BCHC content and configuration so a parent update cannot silently replace operational owners.
- Made validation fail closed when the supported Ruby toolchain is absent or wrong.
- Pinned the complete toolchain and fixed Bundler 4 version detection.
- Fixed live-runner package-manager drift: every PHCT workflow that installs dependencies now
  selects the exact npm declared by `packageManager` after `setup-node`, including both the current
  and candidate toolchains in the updater.
- Added deterministic supply-chain, license, security-exception, SBOM, performance, and
  internal-link gates.
- Added a path-confined gzip release server so browser tests measure production-style transfer
  behavior instead of an uncompressed local artifact.
- Turned Lighthouse performance, accessibility, best-practice, SEO, FCP, LCP, TBT, and CLS
  expectations into blocking budgets.
- Fixed an empty-slug Jekyll warning and parent/downstream test assumptions around optional
  showcase and lock-file data.
- Made the PHCT showcase build suite explicitly optional in downstream repositories that do not
  ship showcase configuration, while retaining the complete preset/module matrix.

No unresolved automated P0 or P1 code defect is known at this checkpoint.

## Release blockers still open

| ID | Required evidence | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| RR-H01 | Review these working-tree changes, commit them to feature branches, and obtain green required CI in PHCT and BCHC. | PHCT maintainer | In progress — PRs #14 and #2 are open and automated CI is green; independent approval is pending. |
| RR-H02 | Tag an immutable PHCT release candidate, run the actual BCHC update workflow, review the checksum report and generated changes, then prove revert/rollback of the update pull request. | PHCT maintainer | Open |
| RR-H03 | Complete a real issue → pull request → media processing → review → merge → Pages deploy → notification rehearsal in both repositories. Use non-sensitive test content and remove it afterward. | Repository admins | Open |
| RR-H04 | Name a BCHC product owner and backup technical maintainer; grant least-privilege access; update `CODEOWNERS`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, and the private contact system. | BCHC sponsor | Open |
| RR-H05 | Verify branch protection, required checks, Pages source/environment protection, Actions permissions, secrets, variables, custom domain/DNS, security settings, labels, and notifications against `docs/bchc/operations-inventory.yml`. | Repository admins | Open |
| RR-H06 | Manually test current Firefox, Safari, Edge, iOS Safari, and Android Chrome plus VoiceOver and NVDA; verify 200%/400% zoom, keyboard-only use, visible focus, forced colors, reduced motion, and representative long/empty/error content. | Accessibility reviewer | Open |

| RR-H08 | Run the approved candidate on the intended Pages configuration for one business day with no unresolved P0/P1 defect and review Actions/Pages behavior before the wider demo. | Release owner | Open |
| RR-H09 | Check presentation-critical external links and contact destinations from the deployed candidate; record any intentionally unreachable or staging-only target. | BCHC content owner | Open |

The 2026-08-22 live audit confirmed that both repositories are public, use `main` as the default
branch, and expose squash, rebase, and merge-commit methods. A connected GitHub application opened
PRs #14 and #2 and verified their live workflow results. The configured GitHub CLI credential is
still invalid, and the connected API does not expose branch rules, Pages/environment settings,
Actions permissions, secrets, variables, DNS, security controls, labels, or notifications. A
repository owner must inspect those surfaces against `docs/bchc/operations-inventory.yml`; CLI
re-authentication with `gh auth refresh -h github.com` is also required before command-line release
and drill work. No credential value belongs in this evidence file or the operations inventory.

## Candidate decision rule

The release owner may change the status to **go** only when every row above has an owner and dated
evidence, both repositories are clean at reviewed commits, required CI is green, and the BCHC lock
references the exact PHCT tag and full commit used by the successful updater rehearsal. Any open
P0/P1 defect, protected-file checksum change without an approved migration, failed accessibility
gate, or unowned operational responsibility is an automatic no-go.
