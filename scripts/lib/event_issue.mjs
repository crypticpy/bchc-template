/**
 * Shared reading of the cohort/event issue forms.
 *
 * The four event scripts (new_event_from_issue, update_event_attachments_from_issue,
 * extract_event_fields, list_events_for_year) each used to carry their own
 * `### heading` splitter. They disagreed with each other and were all
 * last-occurrence-wins, so a heading typed inside a free-text answer replaced
 * the answer GitHub itself collected. They now share this module, which parses
 * through `parseIssueForm` (first occurrence wins, only known headings start a
 * section, everything after the trailing free-text field is prose).
 *
 * The labels below are the ones the generated forms in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
 * emit. Every form's labels are known to every script: a heading has to be
 * recognised to end the previous section, otherwise an unrelated field would be
 * swallowed into the answer above it.
 *
 * Pure: no filesystem beyond path arithmetic, no environment.
 * See test/scripts/event_scripts.test.mjs.
