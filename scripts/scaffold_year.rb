# Scaffold a cohort/program year: the landing page, an events folder and a
# starter schedule data file. Existing files are never overwritten.
#
# Invoked by: the "Scaffold cohort" step in .github/workflows/new-year.yml,
# triggered by an issue labeled `content:new-year` (year read from the issue
# via scripts/extract_event_fields.mjs) or a manual `workflow_dispatch`. That
# workflow opens a PR with the scaffolded files afterwards.
# Env: COHORT_YEAR (required, four digits), COHORT_INTRO (optional).
# Output: writes cohorts/<year>/index.md, cohorts/<year>/events/, and
# _data/cohorts/<year>.yml under the repo root; prints a summary line.

# Render one value as the YAML scalar node Psych itself would write for it
# (plain, quoted or a literal block, whichever the value needs).
#
# COHORT_INTRO reaches this script from an issue form. It used to be emitted
# with String#inspect, which produces escapes YAML does not define (`\#{`,
# `\u{1f600}`) and leaves DEL and the C1 block raw — a crafted intro could
# write a cohort landing page Psych then refuses to parse. Letting Psych do the
# escaping makes every input round-trip.
#
# @param value [Object]
# @return [String] a YAML scalar, safe to interpolate after `key: `
